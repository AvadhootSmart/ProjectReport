The freelancing industry has experienced remarkable growth with the advent of digital platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr, enabling clients and professionals to collaborate across global boundaries. However, these platforms operate under centralized control, leading to challenges such as high service fees, delayed payments, and opaque dispute-resolution mechanisms. 

This project aims to develop a Decentralized Freelance Platform using blockchain technology to overcome these limitations. The system leverages Ethereum-based smart contracts and decentralized storage solutions to create a transparent, secure, and trustless freelancing ecosystem. Through smart contract–driven automation, the platform facilitates escrow-based payments, ensures fair transactions, and eliminates the need for intermediaries. 

By adopting this decentralized approach, freelancers gain greater autonomy and clients experience cost-efficient, transparent collaboration. The outcome is a blockchain-powered freelance marketplace that enhances trust, efficiency, and fairness across the freelancing domain.
